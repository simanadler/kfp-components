# Fybrik Based Housing Price Estimate Pipeline Sample

## Pipeline Overview

This is an enhancement of the pipeline for [house price prediction](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/samples/contrib/versioned-pipeline-ci-samples/kaggle-ci-sample).  We show how by integrating with [Fybrik](https://fybrik.io/v1.0/) the same pipeline benefits from transparent handling of non-functional requirements related to the reading and writing of data, such as the handling of credentials, automatic enforcement of data governance, and automatic allocation and cataloging of the new dataset containing the results.  

Please note that data is read/written via the arrow-flight protocol in this example.

A more detailed explanation of the goals, architecture, and demo screen shots can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xn7pGe5pEAEZxnIzDdom9r7K6s78alcP/view?usp=sharing).

## Prerequisits
* [get_data_endpoints prerequisits and setup](../../get_data_endpoints/README.md)


## Usage
The sample provided assumes that you have put the [training](./data/trainwithpi.csv) and [testing](./data/testwithpi.csv) data sets in some type of data store, for which you have the endpoint and credentials.  The data will be read via arrow-flight protocol.

This example also assumes that Fybrik is configured to use [katalog](https://fybrik.io/v1.0/reference/katalog/) as a data catalog, and OPA is configured as Fybrik's data governance policy manager.  These are the defaults in [Fybrik's quick start](https://fybrik.io/v1.0/get-started/quickstart/)

### Prepare Data Assets and Storage
From within the data folder perform the following steps.

Edit the following files to include the relevant details of where your data is stored.  They currently refer to an IBM cloud object store instance, but use an object store of your choice such as AWS S3, IBM Cloud Object Storage or Ceph.
* house-price-demo-secret.yaml
* testpii-asset.yaml
* trainpii-asset.yaml

Register in the Data Catalog (katalog) the training and testing data to be used by the pipeline, noting the catalog ID of each.
```
kubectl apply -f house-price-demo-secret.yaml -n kubeflow
kubectl apply -f testpii-asset.yaml -n kubeflow
kubectl apply -f trainpii-asset.yaml -n kubeflow
```

### Register Governance Policies

From within the data folder run the following commands to register the data governance policies in the [OPA governance engine being used by Fybrik](https://fybrik.io/v1.0/tasks/using-opa/):

The read policy dictates that columns marked as having personal information should be redacted.

Read Policy:
```
kubectl -n fybrik-system create configmap pii-read-policy --from-file=pii-read-policy.rego
		
kubectl -n fybrik-system label configmap pii-read-policy openpolicyagent.org/policy=rego
		
while [[ $(kubectl get cm pii-read-policy -n fybrik-system -o 'jsonpath={.metadata.annotations.openpolicyagent\.org/policy-status}') != '{"status":"ok"}' ]]; do echo "waiting for policy to be applied" && sleep 5; done
```

The write policy allows all data to be written to any location registered with Fybrik as per the [prequisits](../../get_data_endpoints/README.md).

Write Policy:
```
kubectl -n fybrik-system create configmap allow-write-policy --from-file=allow-write-policy.rego
		
kubectl -n fybrik-system label configmap allow-write-policy openpolicyagent.org/policy=rego
		
while [[ $(kubectl get cm allow-write-policy -n fybrik-system -o 'jsonpath={.metadata.annotations.openpolicyagent\.org/policy-status}') != '{"status":"ok"}' ]]; do echo "waiting for policy to be applied" && sleep 5; done

```

### Compile Pipeline
From within samples/house_price_estimate run one of the following.

If your kubeflow pipeline deployment uses Argo Workflows (the default):
```
python3 pipeline-argo.py
```
This will result in a file called pipelinev1argo.yaml.


If you deployed kubeflow pipeline with tekton as the workflow manager:
```
python3 pipeline-tekton.py
```
This will result in a file called pipelinev1tekton.yaml.

### Upload Pipeline
Upload the file yaml file via the Kubeflow Pipeline GUI.

See slide 17 of the [demo presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xn7pGe5pEAEZxnIzDdom9r7K6s78alcP/view?usp=sharing).

### Run the Pipeline
Create a pipeline run via the Kubeflow Pipeline GUI, providing the following parameters:
* test_dataset_id: testpii-csv
* train_dataset_id:  trainpii-csv

See slide 19 of the [demo presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xn7pGe5pEAEZxnIzDdom9r7K6s78alcP/view?usp=sharing).

### View Pipeline Run Details
Click on each step in the Kubeflow Pipeline GUI and view its log to see the output.  
* get-data-endpoints prints and returns the virtual endpoints for the 3 dataset (test, train, results)
* visualize-table prints a preview of the data, and you can see that the personal information has been obfuscated
* train-model runs trains the machine learning model and then runs it on the test data, printing out a sample of the results
* submit-result prints out the data catalog asset ID of the newly created asset containing the results

See slides 21-24 of the [demo presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xn7pGe5pEAEZxnIzDdom9r7K6s78alcP/view?usp=sharing).
